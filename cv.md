That's why at 33, I started learning JS. 
In the treasury of my knowledge and achievements, you can find the TOP-2 EU 2004 in the Quake3 eSports tournament, 
and the knowledge of doing some different massages. If I will describe everything here, then simply there will 
not be enough time for both me and you.
